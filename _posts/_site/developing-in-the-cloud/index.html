<p>I want to move my development environment to the cloud.  My current setup is poor for a lot of reasons. I have a 120 SSD with half the space dedicated to a Windows 7 instance and the other half being taken up by a Windows 8 VHD.  Both are cluttered, and reaching their storage limits.  What I would like to have is a well curated development environment to do C# development for Windows Mobile apps.  Going to the cloud and taking advantage of accessibility and scalability is exactly what i am looking for<!--more--></p>

<p>With Citrix I could create my own local cloud but I find Amazon AWS &amp; Azure much more promising.  There are plenty of ways to get your web development into the cloud through online services.  <a href="https://c9.io/">Cloud9ide</a> provides a web development environment.  <a href="http://www.cloudshare.com/">Cloudshare</a> gives access to a cloud development platform for Beta Microsoft products.</p>

<p>To speed up setup we can use <a href="http://bitnami.com/">Bitnami</a> for downloading open source stacks that can be hosted in the AWC cloud or on your local PC.  For a fee, Bitnami will host your environment for you, but for gree you can test out the packages for an hour.  I explored a test instance of <a href="http://www.teamst.org/">TestLink</a> for creating test plans, which led me to explore some comparable solutions such as <a href="redmine.org">Redmine for Project Management</a> and<span style='line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;'> </span><a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/rth/' style='line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;'>RTH – Requirements and Testing Hub</a></p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon’s AWS</a> offers a 1 year trial for a micro-instance that has enough computing power, storage, and bandwidth to run a website or web service, making it a great option for testing.  There are options for both Linux and Windows.</p>

<p>What is most encouraging is that people are <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/33955/using-ec2-instance-as-main-development-platform">already moving their development environment to the cloud</a>, and the costs seem to be under control as long <a href="http://blog.michaelckennedy.net/2011/06/13/building-a-cloud-os-for-net-developers-part-2/">as you aren’t careless</a>.</p>
