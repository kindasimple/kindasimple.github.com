<p>I have been playing catchup lately trying to wrap my head around web developmentwith Node.js, and the npm ecosystem. There are so many tools available and packages to stitch together. I&#8217;m in awe of the amount of development in the javascript community. There&#8217;s a lot to learn to become familiar with each project and what it does without even learning how to use it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the more popular tools and frameworks:</p>
<p><strong>Code</strong>: CoffeeScript, TypeScript<br />
<strong>Frameworks</strong>: Express, Flatiron<br />
<strong>Templates</strong>: Jade, Mustache/Handlebars<br />
<strong>Style</strong>: Less, Sass<br />
<strong>Frameworks</strong>: Express, Ember <br />
<strong>Test Frameworks</strong>: Mocha, Selenium <br />
<strong>Platforms</strong>: Angular, Backbone, Meteor<br />
<strong>Package Management</strong>: npm, Bower<br />
<strong>Build</strong>: Grunt, Gulp<br />
<strong>Text Editors</strong>: Sublime, Vim, Brackets<br />
<strong>Database</strong>: MongoDB, CouchDB, Redis</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to pick and choose from. I&#8217;m used to all things Microsoft. Its a very homogonized community with fewer players. Everyone writes c#, uses Visual Studio and <span class="caps">TFS</span>, Microsoft Test Framework, <span class="caps">SQL</span>, MSBuild, and writes <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> websites and services and <span class="caps">XAML</span> in desktop or for windows store apps. Javascript, for me, was someting to be bothered with occasionally when I wanted to use google maps.</p>
<p>Now, there are choices to be made and in this new world I have difficulty coming up with criteria to evaluate upon. I&#8217;m learning how these pieces fit together, and I have scant preferences. My strategy is to see what people around me in the community are using, and to try what they do.</p>
