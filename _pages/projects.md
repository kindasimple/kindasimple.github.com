I'm on a mini-retirement. That gives me time to learn some new skills and play a bit. 

###Windows Phone &amp; Windows 8
I have a few applications in the store. I created Recollection to make it easy to create mnemonics with the Major System. My next windows app that I create will be a tool for locating services for a touring cyclist.

###Node.js
I have been working with node.js for the first time to create some web tools. 

###Scala
I haven't done functional programming since my programming languages course in college where we completed assignments in ML. There are a few functional programming languages that look interesting: Haskell, Clojure, Scala.
